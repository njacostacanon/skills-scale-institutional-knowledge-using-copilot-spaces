# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README links to all standardized process documents for project management at OctoAcme, providing an entry point and quick reference for the whole team.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative project lifecycle that progresses through Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Closure & Retrospective. The methodology emphasizes customer-first principles, small, testable increments, and data-driven decisions. Initiation validates the business need and aligns stakeholders via a Project One-pager. Planning translates vision into actionable backlog items with clear acceptance criteria and Definition of Done. 

Core roles are delineated—Project Manager (delivery, risk, communication), Product Manager (outcomes, prioritization), Developers (implementation and quality), QA/Testers (validation), and Stakeholders (input and approval). Work is organized using a GitHub Projects-based workflow and rigorous QA practices, including small PRs, automated testing, and pre-release verification. Risks are managed continually, escalating from daily standups up to sponsor level when needed.

Communication adopts a rhythm of daily standups, weekly syncs, and monthly stakeholder briefings to maintain transparency and surface blockers quickly. Every sprint, release, or milestone closes with a structured retrospective, converting learnings into actionable improvements. This approach accelerates onboarding, embeds continuous improvement, and ensures reliable delivery through consistent documentation.
